investigation of several methods to visually keep track
of music and/or sound (or even other events, physical,
like motion or acceleration data).

methods used will include:
- low frquency fft
- pattern recognition/identification/ aplifing layering (interference)
   - resulting in: pattern prediction
- particles: small entities representing certain qualities of a sound
   like wavelet, swarming, thus forming a "big picture"
